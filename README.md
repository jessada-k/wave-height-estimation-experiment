## About
The experiments were conducted on a beach in Khao Sam Roi Yot national park in Prachuapkhirikhan Province, Thailand. A sensor node was installed to monitor and record the water surface level every 36 milliseconds. Thus, there were 28 data points in a second or 1,680 data points in one minute. Data used in this study were collected for 35 minutes on 29 June 2023 morning. For our analysis, the 35-minute time series were segmented into 35 1-minute time series.

Y.mat = data from the sensor (35 1-min signals, 1680 samples each)</br>
G.mat = observed water surface levels from the video record
